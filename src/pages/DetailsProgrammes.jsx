Chest dips (lean forward) hit the lower chest, contributing to increased mass, and cable chest flyes enhance the stretch and contraction in the chest, ideal for outer chest definition. Push-ups finish the workout by improving muscle endurance and overall activation, and the decline barbell bench press completes lower chest development for a well-rounded chest.

Wide grip pull-ups focus on the upper back and lats, enhancing your back width and giving you that V-taper look. Bent-over barbell rows build middle back thickness and strengthen the traps, while lat pulldowns develop lat width for a wider back. One-arm dumbbell rows target each side of the back individually, improving muscle symmetry and emphasizing the lats. Seated cable rows are a controlled movement that targets the middle back and traps while improving muscle contraction. Face pulls strengthen the rear delts and improve posture, contributing to a balanced upper back. T-bar rows add thickness to the middle back and develop strong traps. Key tips include focusing on progressive overload, using controlled movements to avoid injury, and maintaining a mind-muscle connection during each set.
